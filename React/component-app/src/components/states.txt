State is the way the React holds on to some informations
that can change over time and needs to be remembered

Kind of like the stateful servers maintain the the state
So eg: if the user has checked the dark mode then the subsequent
movement to other pages maintain the theme as dark so basically site is maintaining a state associated with a user

Hooks are used to enable actions on the page without a full reload
basically eg: A button click performs an action, so the action trigger doesn't
reload the page, rather it performs only the change needed'

The State are preferred over variables to store the information, because
its a feature of react an enables the re-rendering of the component or the
part of component when a change is noticed by the React!!
This auto-rendering on change is great!

Props vs State
Props enable passing information from parent component to child component, but
the State actually enables to maintain state across the website irrespective of the
inheritance hierarchy
