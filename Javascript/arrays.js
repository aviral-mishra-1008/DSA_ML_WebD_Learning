//This is how you save data in the js
//ARRAYS

const arr = ['India', 'Russia', 'China'];

console.log(arr);
console.log(arr[1]); //negative indexing doesn't work

//unlike c++/java we can think of arrays as lists in python
//you can also add function and object into the array

//There are a number of properties and methods in this 

console.log(arr.length);  //functions/methods require () properties don't!

//indexOf() tells index of element
//includes() is like the membership operator
//push() adds new element to the end of an array and returns new lenght of array
//unshift() adds a new element to the beggining of an array and returns new length of array
// pop() removes the last element of array and returns removed element
// shift() removes first element and returns removed element
//sort() sorts th elements in alphabetic and ascending order
// slice() selects part of ana array and return new array
