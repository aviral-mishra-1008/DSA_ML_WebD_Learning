//what's good is like python we don't need to define the datatype and other stuff, we need to simply store values


let a = 4;
console.log('value of a is: ', a);
console.log('the type of a is: ', typeof(a));
//thus we use typeof to write code!


//Type casting
//Type casting is allowed in JS

a = String(a);
console.log('value of a is: ', a);
console.log('the type of a is: ', typeof(a));


//In converting to boolean we consider all non 0 videos as true and only 0, null andv NaN as false
//Converting true to a number result is always 1

//Thus, boolean(), number(), string()
//NaN means Not a Number and string converts to NaN when tried to convert to number except only numeric strings
