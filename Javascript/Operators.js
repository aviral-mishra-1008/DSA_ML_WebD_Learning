const x = 3;
const y = 4;

//x O y is eligible operation where O is any operator in mathematics
// ** here also means exponentiation
// var++/++var or var--/--var are all increament and decreament operators


// remember we cannot use ++ thingy on const data-types


//Assignment wale saare python wale hain +=, -=, *=, %=, **=, /=
//Const mei assignment operators can't work remember

//comparison operators work as they do in python
// === means strict equal to and return true if operands are equal and of same dtype
// !== means strict not equal to and returns true if operands are equal but dtype is not same

//eg

let a = 3;
let b = '3';

console.log(a!=b); //this compares by typecasting so converts '3' to 3
console.log(a!==b);


//logical operators are &&, ||, ! (NOT)
