let a = 12; //these are containers assigned by variables
let b = 23;
console.log(a+b);

//variables can be made using let or const 

//let is used to allocate changeable variables, i.e let age =20; then I say in future age = 30 and print age so answer would be 30 and not 20

//const doesn't allow that! The variables once assigned to const can be changed with time, and we try to use mostly const!

//mostly we need not to add ; after every line
//it is recomended to use ; after every line

//let can be declared and later initialised while const cannot be declared and initialised later

//Rules of javascript variables declaration
// 1. Start with _, $ or alphabet
// 2. No need to start with numbers
// 3. JS is case sensitive
// 4. Keywords can't be variable names
