//Arrow functions are really important!!
const greet = (a)=>{
    console.log(a);
}

greet(3);

//we can also use following syntax

const sq = (num) => num+num; //ab yaha pe catch ye hain ki you can write only one statement and for more than one you need to use curly braces
//for returning an output or running loops use the method of {}
